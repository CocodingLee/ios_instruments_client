# ios\_instruments\_client

This is a command-line tool that can communicate with the iOS Instruments Server.

It was inspired by my [dtxmsg][https://github.com/troybowman/dtxmsg] IDA plugin.

This app is implemented in C++. It should build + run on any recent version of OSX,
and it can work with any recent version of iOS.

## build

run 'make'

## run

$ ./ios\_instruments\_server -h
