# ios\_instruments\_client

This is a command-line tool that can communicate with the iOS Instruments Server.

It was inspired by my work on the [dtxmsg](https://github.com/troybowman/dtxmsg) IDA plugin.

The app is implemented in C++. It should build/run on any recent version of OSX,
and it can work with any recent version of iOS.

## build

$ make

## run

$ ./ios\_instruments\_client -h
